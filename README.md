# TKNGEN

Create and deploy BEP20 / ERC20 tokens with a click of a button...

### tkngen

The *tkngen client* builds on top of the [tkngen-api](https://github.com/sntsabode/tkngen-api). For a full and comprehensive explanation of all the features and caveats of the service please see *tkngen-api's* [documentation](https://github.com/sntsabode/tkngen-api#readme).

<br/>

If you plan on deploying to mainnet ***(not recommended)*** we'd recommend using local instances of the tkngen-api client & server and not using the demo production builds *(although the demo production builds are capable of mainnet deployments)*. For a guide on how to do this, please see *tkngen-api's* [documentation](https://github.com/sntsabode/tkngen-api#readme).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
